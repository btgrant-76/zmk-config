## Notes

- is this an issue with any of the other macros?
- is it an issue outside the IntelliJ editor?

### Boards

#### Le Chiffre

- works
- fails
 
#### le jlwffre

- works
- fails

## TODOs

- [ ] sync up the contents of the two keymaps and flash before testing
- [ ] go through all macros on both boards and see which ones freak out and which ones are fine
    - boards
    - [ ] raise a question about what I'm observing in ZMK help
